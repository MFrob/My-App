Guessing Game - This app has a textfield in the middle. The app generates a random number and the user has 2 chances to guess that number correctly. Enter a number in the textfield and press the button “go” to guess. After the first guess the app gives a hint. For example if your next guess should be higher or lower. These random numbers are initially between 1 and 10. If the user wants to change the range it can simply enter a number in the textfield and press the range button.
